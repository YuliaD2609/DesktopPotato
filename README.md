# DesktopPotato
A cute, interactive desktop pet application. Watch as a family of small potatoes wanders around your screen, interacts with each other, and follows you!
- A larger potato that follows your mouse cursor.
- Four small potatoes that wander independently at the bottom of your screen.
- Potatoes interact when they meet!
- They get scared and run away if your mouse cursor gets too close.
-  They keep you company.
  
To create the executable for Windows:
```bash
npm run make
```
After building, you can find the executable (zip file) in the `out` folder:
`out/make/zip/win32/x64/` (for Windows 64-bit)
